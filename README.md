I'm a Computer Science major at the National University of Singapore, graduating in 2026. I am currently looking for opportunities.

I'm interested in learning about software engineering, parallel computing, full stack, DevOps, system design, computer graphics, and algorithms.

I enjoy designing quality code, and solving real world problems, having contributed to various projects on GitHub and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/tituschewxj).
